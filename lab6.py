"""
To start, we will generate a random interger between 1 and 20; then
based on the result of the random number, we check to see if it falls under
a certin range
if the number is > 15, then the result will = "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, the result will = "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, the result will = "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, the result will = "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, the result will = "Bell"
if the number is not any of the ubove, then the result will = "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user.
An example "Plum Cherries Melon"
